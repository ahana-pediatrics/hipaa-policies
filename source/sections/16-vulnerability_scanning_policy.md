# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Ahana is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Ahana use NPM audits and Dependabot to stay on top of known vulnerabilities in our code and our dependencies.

## 16.1 Applicable Standards

## 16.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

- 10.m - Control of Technical Vulnerabilities

## 16.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

- 164.308(a)(8) - HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. Nessus management is performed by the Ahana Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
2. Nessus is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Ahana networks.
3. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
4. on a weekly basis;
5. after every production deployment.
6. Reviewing Nessus reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, is the responsibility of the Ahana Security Officer. The process for reviewing Nessus reports is outlined below:
7. The Security Officer initiates the review of a Nessus Report by creating an Issue in the Ahana Tracking System.
8. The Security Officer, or a Ahana Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the Nessus Report.
9. If new vulnerabilities are found during review, the process outlined below is used to test those vulnerabilities. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.
10. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review.
11. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
12. In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:

- All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
- Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Ahana.
  - Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
  - Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Ahana Risk Assessment Policy.

6. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Ahana. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Tracking System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
7. Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Ahana vulnerability management policy.

- External penetration testing is performed annually by a third party.
- Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly. Below is the process used to conduct internal penetration tests.
  1. The Security Officer initiates the penetration test by creating an Issue in the Ahana Tracking System.
  2. The Security Officer, or a Ahana Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to conduct the penetration test.
  3. Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Ahana Security Officer before the Issue can move to be approved.
  4. Once the testing is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further testing and review.
  5. If the Issue is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
- Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Ahana.
- Internal penetration testing is monitored on an annual basis using the Tracking System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

8. This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
