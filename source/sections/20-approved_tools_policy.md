# 20. Approved Tools Policy

Ahana utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by Ahana, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity. Use of other tools requires approval from Ahana leadership.
