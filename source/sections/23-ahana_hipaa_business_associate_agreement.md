THIS HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) supplements and is made a
part of the Telemedicine Platform License Agreement (the “Underlying Agreement”) by and between Provider
(“Covered Entity”) and Ahana Pediatrics, Inc., (“Business Associate”) (each a “Party” and collectively, the
“Parties”) and is effective as of the effective date of the Underlying Agreement (the “Effective Date”).

_WITNESSETH_:

_WHEREAS_, in connection with the Underlying Agreement, Business Associate may create, receive,
maintain or transmit on behalf of Covered Entity, or otherwise receive from Covered Entity, certain Protected
Health Information (“PHI”); and

_WHEREAS_, Covered Entity and Business Associate intend to protect the privacy and provide for the
security of PHI disclosed to Business Associate pursuant to the Underlying Agreement in compliance with: (i) the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191 and the Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Public Law 111-005 (collectively, “HIPAA”) and the privacy,
security and breach notification regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time (collectively, the
“HIPAA Regulations”), and (ii) other applicable laws; and

_WHEREAS_, the purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the requirements necessary to satisfy
certain standards and requirements of HIPAA and the HIPAA Regulations.

_NOW, THEREFORE_, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

**A. Definitions.** Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all capitalized terms used herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the HIPAA Regulations.

**B. Purpose for which Business Associate May Use or Disclose PHI.** The Parties hereby agree that
except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, Business Associate shall be permitted to use or disclose PHI provided
or made available from Covered Entity to perform any function, activity or service for, or on behalf of, Covered
Entity as specified in the Underlying Agreement, provided that such use or disclosure would not violate the HIPAA
Regulations if done by Covered Entity.

**C. Business Associate Obligations.** Business Associate covenants and agrees that it shall:

1. Not use or further disclose PHI other than as permitted or required under this
   Agreement or as required by applicable law or regulation.
2. Implement the administrative, physical and technical safeguards set forth in 45 C.F.R §
   164.302-318 and otherwise reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and
   availability of the electronic PHI that it creates, receives, maintains or transmits on behalf of Covered
   Entity and to use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as permitted
   under this Agreement.
3. Use appropriate safeguards to maintain the security of and prevent unauthorized
   access, use and disclosure of Covered Entity’s PHI. Such safeguards will include a written information
   security program.
4. Require any of its Subcontractors or other third parties with which Business Associate
   does business that are provided PHI or electronic PHI on behalf of Covered Entity, to agree, in writing, to
   adhere to the same restrictions and conditions on the use and disclosure of PHI that apply to Business
   Associate under this Agreement.
5. To the extent Business Associate maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set, make
   available to Covered Entity upon written request from Covered Entity, such information as is necessary to
   fulfill Covered Entity’s obligations to provide PHI: (a) pursuant to an Individual’s right to obtain a copy of
   his or her PHI under 45 C.F.R. § 164.524(a); (b) that may be related to an Individual’s right to amend his
   or her PHI under 45 C.F.R. § 164.526; and (c) that may be required to provide an accounting of
   disclosures pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 164.528. In the event of a request by an individual directly to Business
   Associate for an accounting, Business Associate will provide such an accounting in accordance with
   regulations and standards adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
   (the “Secretary”). Business Associate shall also, as directed by Covered Entity, incorporate any
   amendments to PHI into copies of such PHI maintained by Business Associate.
6. Make available to the Secretary all internal practices, books and records relating to the
   use and disclosure of PHI received from, or created by, Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity,
   for purposes of determining Covered Entity’s or Business Associate’s compliance with the HIPAA
   Regulations. The Parties’ respective rights and obligations under this Section C(6) shall survive the
   termination of the Underlying Agreement.
7. During the term of the Underlying Agreement, notify Covered Entity of any Breach of
   Unsecured PHI. Notice will include the identification of each individual whose Unsecured PHI has been or
   is reasonably believed by Business Associate to have been accessed, acquired, used or disclosed during
   such Breach and other information necessary for Covered Entity to fulfill any Breach notification
   obligations.
8. Disclose to its Subcontractors or other third parties, and request from Covered Entity,
   only the minimum PHI necessary, in Business Associate’s judgment, to perform or fulfill a specific
   function required or permitted by this Agreement.
9. Business Associate shall not receive remuneration directly or indirectly in exchange for
   PHI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this provision shall not prohibit payment by
   Covered Entity for services provided by Business Associate pursuant to the Underlying Agreement.
10. Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI for fundraising or for marketing
    purposes unless such use or disclosure is pursuant to the Underlying Agreement or another written
    agreement that does not violate HIPAA.

**D. Permitted Uses and Disclosures.** Business Associate agrees that it shall not use or disclose PHI in
any manner, form, or in any means that is contrary to its obligations under the Underlying Agreement or this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that, pursuant to federal law, Business Associate may:

1. Use PHI in its possession for its proper management and administration and to
   fulfill any of its present or future legal responsibilities provided that such uses are permitted under state
   and federal confidentiality laws.
2. Disclose PHI in its possession to third parties for the purpose of its proper
   management and administration or to fulfill any of its present or future legal responsibilities provided that
   (i) the disclosures are required by law, as provided for in 45 C.F.R. § 164.501, or (ii) Business Associate
   has received from the third party written assurances that the PHI will be held confidentially, that the PHI
   will only be used or further disclosed as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to
   the third party, and that the third party will notify Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware
   in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached, as required under 45 C.F.R. §
   164.504(e)(4).

3. Use PHI in its possession to provide data aggregation services relating to the health care operations of the Covered Entity.

**E. Termination.** Notwithstanding any other provision under the Underlying Agreement and pursuant
to federal law, Business Associate agrees that the Underlying Agreement may be terminated by Covered Entity
should Covered Entity determine that Business Associate has violated a material term of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision under the Underlying Agreement and pursuant to federal law,
Covered Entity agrees that the Underlying Agreement may be terminated by Business Associate should Business
Associate determine that Covered Entity has violated a material term of this Agreement.

**F. Return or Destruction of PHI.** Upon termination, cancellation, or expiration of the Underlying
Agreement, if feasible, Business Associate shall return to Covered Entity or destroy in accordance with standards
promulgated by the Secretary, any and all PHI received from, or created by, Business Associate on behalf of
Covered Entity that is maintained by Business Associate in any form. Should the return or destruction of the PHI
be determined by Business Associate, in its sole discretion, to be infeasible, the Parties agree that the terms of this
Agreement shall extend to the PHI until otherwise indicated by Covered Entity, and any further use or disclosure
of the PHI by Business Associate shall be limited to that purpose which renders the return or destruction of the
PHI infeasible.

**G. Amendment to Comply with Law.** The parties acknowledge that state and federal laws relating to
electronic data security and privacy are rapidly evolving and that amendment of this Agreement may be required to
ensure compliance with such developments. Specifically, the parties acknowledge and agree that the January 25,
2013 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services final rule entitled, “Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy,
Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules under the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act” (the “HIPAA Omnibus Rule”) imposes
new requirements on business associates with respect to privacy, security and Breach notification. The HIPAA
Omnibus Rule provisions applicable to business associates are hereby incorporated by reference into this
Agreement as if set forth in this Agreement in their entirety and will become effective upon their respective
effective dates. Upon either Party’s request, the other Party agrees to promptly to enter into negotiations concerning
the terms of any amendment to this Agreement as may be necessary to comply with applicable law.

**H. No Third Party Beneficiaries.** Nothing express or implied in this Agreement is intended to confer,
nor shall anything herein confer, upon any person other than Covered Entity, Business Associate, and their
respective successors or assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities whatsoever.

**I. Termination.** This Agreement shall expire when all of the PHI provided by Covered Entity to
Business Associate is destroyed or returned to Covered Entity pursuant to Section G. The Parties agree that Sections
B, C and D of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of the Underlying Agreement.
